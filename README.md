# Questions you should consider asking your Interviewer and Future Company


## Introduction

This is the list of questions that you should consider asking your interviewer and future company. When they ask **Do you have any questions for me**, take the opportunity to know what your 
future in this company or under this person might look like. This list is divided into [general](#general-questions) and [technology specific](#technology-specific-questions) questions along with tips and tricks.

## Tips before asking these questions

- Ask these questions on call during impromptu conversation to know the immediate reaction. Don't ask these questions by email.
- Don't ask all these questions at once. Pick and choose the top few questions that are most relevant to you.
- Don't ask just for the sake of asking. Be really interested and curious to know about the culture and people you are planning to work with.
- Don't be afraid to ask these questions. Your career is at stake. Where you work matters to you, your family, and everyone around you. Good companies and interviewers welcome such open questions and discussions. Companies that discourage open questions aren’t worth your time.
- Remember to listen to the answers intently. It's easy to wash over a bad answer just because you're excited about other parts of the job. If a red flag gets raised then give its due attention. Thanks to [Simon Barker](https://twitter.com/allthecode_) for this tip.
